Rock, Paper, Scissors Game (simple UI version)

This is a project for The Odin Project curriculum and my first game created with Javascript. The game plays rounds of "Rock, Paper, Scissors" up to five points against a computer opponent. This version has clickable buttons to play and a photo of my dog.
